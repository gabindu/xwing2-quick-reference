# X-Wing Heroes of the Aturi Cluster (2.07.05) Quick Reference Cards

![HotAC Quick Reference Cards](hotac-quick-reference.jpg)

This is a fork of the excellent [quick reference by Nicholas Piegdon](https://github.com/npiegdon/xwing2-quick-reference), originally for X-Wing 2.0, updated to X-Wing 2.5, and including a summary of all important game-specific rules to the [Heroes of the Aturi Cluster](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vuEwgyzACV01iHs_k4dryoUbWlhCmNVY?fbclid=IwAR1crXrh9q47ywjW5ZM5OZXlKdg3qXeSTOaRZZEovdyjIPDcylPavx86MDk) cooperative campaign.

## Content

The document consists of 3 double-sided sheets, with the following content:

- A general X-Wing 2.5 rules summary, with two changes relevant to HotAC: the initiative and gas cloud rules (emphasized in blue).
- A summary of all major devices (bombs, mines, and remotes). (Many of these will never appear in a HotAC campaign, but were included for completeness sake.)
- A summary of HotAC specific rules, including rules for the extension Ground Assault.

It's recommended to print these sheets double-sided on cardstock and laminate them.  The first sheet could be printed several times, one for each player. The other two sheets probably suffice once.

## Version

All rules are following the [Atomic Mass Games Rules Reference 1.4.1](https://www.atomicmassgames.com/s/SWZ_RulesReference_v141web.pdf) (for the general X-Wing 2.5 rules), as well as the HotAC 2.07.05 release.

### Where's the PDF?

The pdf-file is directly included in the repository, next to the original Adobe Illustrator file.
